The mental health impact of Covid and the stress of the pandemic continue to affect nearly every community. The share of Georgia adults who reported increased anxiety or depression spiked by 30% in 2021, yet we have 143 mental health care providers for every 100,000 people in Georgia. Our rural health care delivery system, already fragile due to Georgia\u2019s failure to expand Medicaid, has been stretched even further by the Covid pandemic, and our rural communities are reeling. In Hancock County, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gpb.org\/news\/2022\/01\/05\/hancock-county-reaches-grim-covid-milestone-i-feel-the-pain-says-county-coroner\">one out of every 100 people<\/a> has died from Covid complications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Covid has ravaged our state, other health care challenges have persisted. Georgia leads much of the nation in the number of uninsured, a terrible ranking with real consequences. Our state\u2019s children are also in jeopardy: About four-in-ten of our counties have no general pediatricians. Additionally, about half of our counties have no Ob\/Gyns and about half have no psychiatrists. Georgia\u2019s continued inaction on Medicaid expansion is a catastrophe for our families, our communities, our under-resourced public health and our overworked hospital system<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As governor, I will work every day to directly address our state\u2019s health outcomes, strengthen our state\u2019s health care delivery system and increase access to meaningful health coverage for all Georgians.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All Georgians deserve access to quality, affordable healthcare services to support their physical and mental well-being and to experience financial security.
