My job will be to earn and keep your trust through an ethical, open, transparent, and secure state government focused on the public interest\u2014not special interests and not my interests. As governor, I will be committed to expanding on my proven track record to build a state where every Georgian can trust that the office of the governor is serving on their behalf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have built my career on ethical and transparent leadership. I volunteered as legal counsel to newly-elected Mayor Shirley Franklin\u2019s ethics commission in 2002, and I was a legal advisor to the city\u2019s Ethics Office as Deputy City Attorney from 2003 to 2006. As a state legislator, I held frequent town halls in my district and regularly distributed a legislative session email to constituents detailing my votes on legislation and served on the House Ethics Committee. For constitutional amendments, I explained the pros and cons of the legislation and my reasoning for how I planned to vote. I consistently supported transparency measures, including a bill to launch the <a href=\"https:\/\/open.ga.gov\/\">Open Georgia<\/a> website on government finances and a bill requiring an annual accounting of tax breaks. I served as a board member of Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University and co-edited a book on ethical leadership in the 21st century.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My <em>Ethics and Public Integrity Platform<\/em> rewrites the rules to work in favor of all families, making state government more open, transparent, and accountable to Georgians. Right now, most Georgians find our state government too complex, too inaccessible and too opaque. They have little confidence in elected officials, question the motivations of people working in government, believe their tax dollars are wasted and assume decisions are made in someone else\u2019s best interest. Too often, they\u2019re right. No citizen should trust those in power who are also willing to ban peaceful protest, censor history and curtail women\u2019s bodily autonomy and access to healthcare. Under my leadership, everyone working for my administration will be held to the highest of ethical standards. We will make it our duty to build trust in our state government.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can build a better Georgia for everyone, renew integrity in governance, and earn confidence from the people of our state. If we do right by our people, we can get more done for our future, moving Georgia to its next and greatest chapter. My plan for strong ethical leadership as governor of Georgia will ensure that voters know I am always on their side, ready to serve.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our Ethics and Public Integrity Platform has one core message: I promise to serve you as the next governor of Georgia.
