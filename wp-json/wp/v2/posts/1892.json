During the&nbsp;roundtable, Abrams discussed her plans to expand Medicaid, fully fund education, keep Georgians safe, and ensure that the state\u2019s economy works for every Georgian.<br>&nbsp;<br>\u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of the governor to not create divisions amongst us by using our language, our history, our race, our background, or zip code or access to power as a way to tell us that we are separated,\u201d Abrams said during the&nbsp;roundtable. \u201cMy mission is to be governor of one Georgia, a governor focused on education, on health care and on jobs, making certain that every single Georgian has the opportunity for success.\u201d<br>&nbsp;<br>During the&nbsp;roundtable, Abrams highlighted her previous work in the&nbsp;Koreancommunity and commitment to building diverse political power in the state of Georgia.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u201cI [have] worked with the&nbsp;Korean&nbsp;community. I did so as a state legislator. I did so as minority leader,\u201d said Abrams. \u201cI was intentional about making sure we were not only growing staff, [but] also growing interns who knew both policy and politics to build the political power of the AAPI community.\u201d<br>&nbsp;<br>Abrams also connected her experience as a successful entrepreneur and small business owner to her commitment to breaking down barriers as governor.<br>&nbsp;<br>\u201cI am a tax attorney by training but I also started a small business called NowAccount. NowAccount actually functioned as a way to get access to capital to small businesses and we specialized in targeting minority businesses that had difficulty reaching traditional sources of capital. My goal is to do the work at the governor&#8217;s office that I&#8217;ve been doing in the private sector, the public sector and the nonprofit sector for more than 20 years. I want this job because I believe that we are one Georgia. We come from very diverse backgrounds. We have very different stories about where we are from and where we are going but the responsibility of the governor is to remove the barriers that would stop us from getting there.\u201d<br>&nbsp;<br>Additionally, on Monday, the Abrams for Governor campaign launched the&nbsp;Korean&nbsp;translation of its campaign website.
