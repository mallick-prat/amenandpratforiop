According to the Georgia Department of Public Health, from October 2021 to May 2022, Georgia destroyed 16,459 containers of returned formula, which included 11,724 containers of powdered formula, 3,000 containers of ready-to-use formula, and 1,735 containers of concentrate. The decision to waste infant formula had a deleterious effect on babies and families across the state of Georgia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gubernatorial policy, which relied on non-binding guidance from the USDA, impacted the ability of the state to meet its obligation with regard to the distribution of infant formula required by law. The leadership of multiple states rejected the advisory, including the states of Michigan and Texas. Furthermore, the investigative article referenced above reported that the policy administered under Gov. Kemp likely exacerbated the crisis. In June 2022, Georgia ranked nationally as the state most affected by the infant formula shortage, with out-of-stock rates at 94% compared to national average rate of 74%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the panic has receded from the headlines, the consequences of this policy continue to impact Georgia parents and children. Therefore, the wasteful actions of the Kemp administration warrant further illumination. We are also troubled by the failure of the Kemp administration to adequately account for its decision and continued destruction of formula when the shortage had received national attention and led to the hospitalization of infants due to lack of access.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We, the undersigned, therefore, request that your office investigate the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The discrepancy in reliance on non-binding guidance that led the Kemp administration to make such a significant wasteful error where other states avoided such a grievous decision,&nbsp;<\/li><li>Whether further clarification or advisory input from the USDA was pursued by the Kemp administration given the high percentage of families reliant on WIC and other programs in the state, and&nbsp;<\/li><li>Why the Kemp administration delayed action by more than 60 days to remedy the policy to waste infant formula in the face of clear and urgent need.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This investigation would be an appropriate follow-up given the executive branch commitment to addressing and resolving the infant formula crisis and establishing protocols to prevent the danger such unchecked actions have posed to the children of Georgia.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">###<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Complaint&nbsp;calls for Inspector General to look into wasteful
