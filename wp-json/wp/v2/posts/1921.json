The video, narrated by Abrams, features images of Georgians from across the state and outlines Abrams\u2019 efforts over the last four years to build a \u201cstronger Georgia.\u201d From her fierce advocacy for voting rights, to supplying food banks during the pandemic, to eliminating medical debt for tens of thousands of Georgians, Abrams has dedicated herself to delivering for Georgia.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOpportunity and success in Georgia shouldn\u2019t be determined by your zip code, background or access to power,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cFor the past four years, when the hardest times hit us all, I\u2019ve worked to do my part to help families make it through. My job has been to just put my head down and keep working \u2014 toward One Georgia.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georgia Democrats are riding a wave of momentum into the gubernatorial race, sweeping seven key municipal races statewide in yesterday\u2019s runoff elections, including the victory of the first woman and first Black mayor elected to lead the City of Warner Robins in strongly Republican Houston County. The strong local performance follows Democrats\u2019 first presidential victory in the state in nearly 30 years and two U.S. Senate seat pickups in runoff elections earlier this year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under current leadership, Georgia has endured ongoing attacks on the right to vote and freedom to choose, the priority of ideology over economic well-being, a failure to expand Medicaid, an underfunded education system and a void of leadership during the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Added Abrams, \u201cIf our Georgia is going to move to its next and greatest chapter, we are going to need leadership. Leadership that knows how to do the job. Leadership that doesn\u2019t take credit without also taking responsibility. Leadership that works hard. Leadership that measures progress not by stats but by our ability for everyone to move up and thrive. Leadership that understands the true pain folks are feeling and has real plans. That\u2019s the job of Governor.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abrams for Governor will hold a major statewide campaign launch in the coming months.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Full script of the announcement video is below:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I\u2019ve worked a lot of jobs in my life.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And for the past four years, when the hardest times hit us all, I\u2019ve worked to do my part to help families make it through.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Paying off medical debt for tens of thousands of Georgians\u2026 expanding access to vaccines\u2026 bringing supplies to overwhelmed food banks\u2026 lending a hand across our state, especially in rural Georgia.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We helped finance small businesses trying to stay afloat, and I spoke up for families being left behind.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And while my jobs have changed, what I know to be true has not: That our values are still strong. No matter where we come from in Georgia or how long we\u2019ve been here, we believe in this place and our people, folks who deserve to be seen and heard and have a voice.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Because in the end,&nbsp;<\/em><em>we are one Georgia.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And so, regardless of the pandemics or the storms.
