The memo showcases how the victory of abortion rights supporters in Kansas is a great sign for Democrats in Georgia and across the country.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, yesterday, the campaign released a new TV ad,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/staceyabrams\/status\/1554830008350216196?emci=b81a3e4d-a613-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">Signed<\/a>, featuring women in Georgia calling attention to the dangers of Brian Kemp\u2019s extreme abortion ban.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGeorgia\u2019s women and those who love them have the ability to fight for reproductive freedom, liberty from interference into private medical decisions and the full scope of health care. The gubernatorial race is already close, the incumbent is below 50%, and Kemp\u2019s extreme and unpopular attacks on women are disqualifying to a substantial majority of voters,\u201d said&nbsp;<strong>Lauren Groh-Wargo<\/strong>. \u201cThe time to act is now &#8211; this race can be won, provided that we invest in the people of Georgia and ensure that they can hear about how Stacey Abrams will deliver for Georgians, stop Kemp\u2019s far right, extreme agenda, and how Kemp\u2019s radical tenure has already and will continue to endanger women across the state.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ajc.com\/politics\/interactive-poll-of-georgia-voters-july-2022\/BMIROIWOEBCLRMG7HYCOK4RUSI\/?emci=b81a3e4d-a613-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">polling<\/a>&nbsp;from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows that Kemp\u2019s radical anti-abortion laws are wildly unpopular with Georgia voters \u2014 with Georgia voters opposing the overturning of Roe 39%-54%, Kemp\u2019s six week ban 36%-54%, and a total ban on abortion 21%-72%. Abrams for Governor\u2019s internal polling is consistent with what the AJC poll shows when it comes to the motivational impact of abortion on this election. Georgia Democrats are almost completely unified in telling pollsters that abortion is important and motivational to them in 2022. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Overall Abrams for Governor\u2019s internal research has shown:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Abortion is a bigger motivator for GA Democrats than it is for GA Republicans.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Independent voters in GA are overwhelmingly pro-choice and Kemp\u2019s record of criminalizing abortion is very damaging among them.&nbsp;<\/li><li>A measurable block of GA Republican voters defect from Kemp\u2019s hard right orthodoxy on abortion and oppose Kemp\u2019s anti-choice agenda.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Abortion access and women&#8217;s liberty are on the ballot this year in Georgia. In his first year, Governor Kemp&#8217;s priority was signing one of the country&#8217;s most extreme and dangerous abortion laws, a law that prevents women from getting life-saving healthcare. His cruel bill sets women up to be investigated and criminalized if they miscarry; threatens to jail doctors who provide life-saving care; and forces rape and incest victims to file police reports to access care. His law bans abortion before most women know they are pregnant, stripping women of their freedom and dictating the personal medical decision of women and their families. This election is a contrast between having a governor who will fight to protect women&#8217;s reproductive freedom versus a Governor bent on controlling women&#8217;s bodies for his political gain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the full memo&nbsp;<a
