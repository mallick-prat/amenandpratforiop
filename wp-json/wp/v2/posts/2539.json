There, founder Michael Maddox showed off the vegetable gardens that help feed the 10 families that live in the 25-acre \u201cagrihood,\u201d where small houses and wooded lots are the norm. Maddox\u2019s blueberry crop failed in each of the last two years after producing berries for two decades. \u201cI lost my entire blueberry crop to a late freeze,\u201d he said, blaming the unpredictability on climate change. Abrams is worried about climate change, too, especially along the Georgia coast and in South Georgia where small farmers like Maddox struggle with a less stable climate and all the residents face growing threats from hurricanes and rising sea levels. Her concerns are part of a seven-page environmental protection and resilience plan Abrams unveiled in an interview with The Current.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Brunswick News<\/strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/thebrunswicknews.com\/news\/local_news\/abrams-discusses-environmental-policy-plans-during-st-simons-campaign-stop\/article_c3f51aa8-63d4-5c7e-b9de-c215d9c3c22a.html?emci=9c47a965-b224-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">Abrams discusses environmental policy plans during St. Simons campaign stop<\/a>&nbsp;<br>August 24, 2022<br>By Lauren McDonald<br>&nbsp;<br>\u201cState gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams stopped Tuesday by St. Simons Island to host a conversation about what she\u2019ll do as governor to address environmental issues in Georgia. \u201cIf we are not doing the fundamental work of protecting our environment, preparing for resilience and creating new opportunities that put us on the forefront of environmentally advanced energy, then we are losing the race to save Georgia\u2019s future,\u201d Abrams told a small group gathered at the Casino. She said this issue is personal to her, based in part on her childhood experience growing up near \u201cCancer Alley,\u201d a stretch of lands along the Mississippi River that contains more than 150 petrochemical plants and refineries, as well as her professional experience working with the Environmental Protection Agency and with the Office of Environmental Justice. She said she\u2019s also fought against legislation as a state representative in Georgia that would have caused significant environmental harm. \u201cOur environment is our responsibility,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cAnd my mission as the next governor of Georgia is to protect our state, and that means protecting the Okenefokee swamp, protecting the coastline, protecting Coastal Georgia, protecting South Georgia.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WFXL<\/strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/wfxl.com\/news\/local\/show-up-and-say-we-want-more-we-deserve-more-stacey-abrams-visits-camilla?emci=9c47a965-b224-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">\u201cShow up and say we want more, we deserve more,&#8221; Stacey Abrams visits Camilla<\/a>&nbsp;<br>August 24, 2022<br>By Taylor Thompson<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOn Wednesday afternoon, Stacey Abrams, who&#8217;s running for Governor against Incumbent Brian Kemp, visited Camilla. The visit was one of many on her &#8220;One Georgia&#8221; tour around the state where she has discussed her plans to better help the people of Georgia without raising taxes. &#8220;We need to invest in the future of Georgia, we need to invest in the children of Georgia, we need to invest in the opportunities in Georgia,&#8221; said Abrams. She added that the state already has the resources necessary to fix the problems they know too well. Abrams plans if elected is to lower the cost of healthcare, expand affordable housing, create jobs and fully fund education all without raising taxes. She believed that there&#8217;s a real chance to do right and make the needed changes without raising taxes as the state already has the money.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">###<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ATLANTA&nbsp;&#8211; Democratic nominee for Governor of Georgia, Stacey Abrams, recently continued her \u201cOne Georgia\u201d tour with stops in Coastal and South Georgia.
