Abrams also called on Governor Brian Kemp to immediately investigate whether COVID relief funds can be used to send stimulus checks to Georgians struggling with inflation, and urged Kemp to work with the Biden administration to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGeorgians need money in their pockets and a roof over their heads \u2013 and we need to invest to help them meet this moment,\u201d said&nbsp;<strong>Stacey Abrams<\/strong>. \u201cWhen I am elected Governor, we\u2019re going to deliver assistance to working Georgians worth $500 for joint filers, $375 for heads of households, and $250 for single tax filers through tax credits. Due to our budget surplus and COVID relief money, we can do this plus lower healthcare costs, pay public workers a living wage and invest in rural Georgia, all without raising taxes on anyone. If we focus on Georgia families rather than tax giveaways to millionaires as Kemp has, we can afford to do the right thing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf Brian Kemp cares about helping Georgia families deal with rising costs, he should work with our U.S. Senators to investigate whether he can immediately use ARP funds to issue these relief checks to Georgians. Unfortunately, throughout this crisis, he has criticized the financial help Democrats have provided and refused to work with the Biden administration to help hardworking families. Once again, Democrats have delivered for Georgia, and Georgians need help now. As soon as I am in office, I promise we are going to deliver for them.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georgia is on track to end the year with a surplus worth&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ajc.com\/politics\/state-of-georgia-ends-fiscal-year-with-23-increase-in-revenue\/VKIVE5ATYNHUFKZYTRIIRY4OFI\/?emci=a5863875-beff-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">over $6 billion<\/a>&nbsp;along with the state receiving&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ajc.com\/politics\/georgia-gets-24-billion-more-in-covid-19-relief-how-will-it-be-spent\/HKYVUVBGERBQTA22X5YQQ4BG3M\/?emci=a5863875-beff-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">more than $2 billion in COVID relief money<\/a>&nbsp;due to the American Rescue Plan passed by Democrats.
