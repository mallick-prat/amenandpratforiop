Even an infusion of federal relief dollars couldn\u2019t keep stave off the hospital\u2019s financial ruin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abrams was introduced by a nurse who told supporters her aunt died because she couldn\u2019t get an ambulance in time from the closest hospital that could dispatch one \u2013 a medical facility miles away in Alabama.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat is a travesty.

Medicaid expansion is a key portion of her 2022 platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georgia is one of 12 states that has not expanded Medicaid, a program that helps low-income residents gain health coverage. A bid by Kemp for a more limited expansion that includes a work requirement was rejected by the Biden Administration. Kemp sued the federal government in an effort to get the decision reversed. Full expansion would give an estimated half a million Georgians access to health coverage, including roughly 10,000 people in Muscogee County, she said. Abrams also blamed the closure of a hospital in the rural city of Cuthbert on Kemp because he \u201cwas too mean to expand Medicaid in the state of Georgia.\u201d \u201cSome states have been generous with their support,\u201d Abrams said of Medicaid. \u201cGeorgia has been a miser. We live in a state where if you are a childless adult, no matter how much you work and how little you make, we will not help you. That is a travesty in the best of times.

They argue the state cannot afford a full expansion, while Abrams said the state has the funds to pay into it. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A full expansion of Medicaid to cover 500,000 more Georgians will cost $347 million, Abrams said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe will see a reduction in the uncompensated care numbers in Georgia,\u201d Abrams explained. \u201cUncompensated care, which is how much we pay for people who get health care but can&#8217;t pay their bill, is $2.7 billion a year. And so Georgians are already paying for Medicaid expansion. We&#8217;re already paying for people who don&#8217;t have health care. I&#8217;m simply saying let&#8217;s bring our money home and let&#8217;s match it with the dollars that we have here.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georgia is one of a dozen states that hasn\u2019t expanded Medicaid, despite federal incentives. Abrams said expanding Medicaid could have several benefits including a decrease in health care costs, an increase in health incomes, support for rural hospitals and creating nearly 64,000 new jobs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cInstead of cherry picking communities that would benefit from economic development, Medicaid expansion would put economic development jobs in every single region in the state,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cThere&#8217;s neither an economic nor a partisan reason not to expand it.
