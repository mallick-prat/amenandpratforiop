Her plan would legalize sports betting through legislation while supporting a constitutional amendment to allow casinos that would generate revenue allowing Georgia to invest in education while also growing jobs and the economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGeorgia must provide a pathway for students to secure higher education \u2013 especially those who are blocked from receiving this life-changing learning because they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Abrams. \u201cI know firsthand how much of a difference access to higher education can make toward building future opportunity. Right now, Georgia is the only state in the south without need-based financial aid. My plan will change that while providing a permanent stream of revenue that can be used to provide critical financial aid and make technical college free, all without raising taxes and while we grow our economy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georgia is currently one of only two states that does not offer need-based financial aid for students \u2013 even as 40% or more of Georgia\u2019s college students can\u2019t afford basic costs or they experience food or housing insecurity. For Georgia students and adults facing a changing economy, technical college is a valuable path to new skills and greater competencies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abrams&#8217; plan would tax sports betting at 20% \u2013 the same rate as Tennessee \u2013 while also implementing licensing fees. The plan would also propose one to three licenses to open casinos in Georgias as an initial investment. Determination of location and size would be subject to updated studies, proposals and other components of enabling legislation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies project the potential for billions in economic impact and new opportunities to grow jobs and make our economy stronger for all Georgians.
