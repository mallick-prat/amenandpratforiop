Abrams says, if elected she plans to change that. Along with providing more funds to go towards work-study programs and Hope scholarships. &#8220;If we increase financial aid and we increase investment in education then the costs come down [for students], but also the quality continues to increase,\u201d said Abrams.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WCTV:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wctv.tv\/2022\/09\/07\/stacey-abrams-one-georgia-tour-stops-valdosta\/?emci=efc95008-9f2f-ed11-ae83-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">Stacey Abram\u2019s \u2018One Georgia\u2019 tour stops in Valdosta<\/a><\/strong><br>By: Brandon Spencer<br>September 7, 2022<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAbrams started off her day at VSU where she spoke to students who were excited to see a gubernatorial candidate that looks like them. \u201cIt definitely feels nice to see another black female in here talking to us about issues that matter,\u201d shared VSU Senior Mi\u2019Yoshia Blow. \u201cEspecially for college students and the fact that she took the time out of your day to come here.\u201d Abrams said she wants the students to know she has their backs. \u201cI want to make certain that we are expanding access to opportunity by investing in our children and by making sure we are paying our teachers a living, explained Georgia Gubernatorial Candidate Stacey Abrams. \u201cWhich is what I wanted to talk to the Valdosta students about, to increase financial aid because too many of our students our dropping out of college because they can\u2019t afford to stay.\u201d These statements make students like Blow believe Abrams will have an advantage for the younger generations. \u201cHer coming out and actually like starting to put her foot into our communities and back into our communities will definitely help her in this election,\u201d Blow said. \u201cAnd I definitely commend her on coming out here and I feel honored to meet her.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Valdosta Daily Times:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.valdostadailytimes.com\/news\/abrams-touts-medicaid-expansion-candidate-meets-valdosta-residents-students\/article_10863bf8-2eef-11ed-9875-ebe4b90974d6.html?emci=efc95008-9f2f-ed11-ae83-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">Abrams touts Medicaid expansion: Candidate meets Valdosta residents, students<\/a><\/strong><br>By: Malia Thomas&nbsp;<br>September 8, 2022<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAbrams criticized Gov.
