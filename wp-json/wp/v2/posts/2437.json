Her plan will work to address the four central housing challenges that too many of Georgia&#8217;s families face in urban, suburban, and rural communities every day:&nbsp;<strong>unaffordability<\/strong>&nbsp;of homes for too many households, shrinking&nbsp;<strong>inventory<\/strong>&nbsp;of housing, displacement of longtime residents due to&nbsp;<strong>gentrification<\/strong>, and the preventable tragedy of&nbsp;<strong>homelessness<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cI am committed to helping our families keep a roof over their heads and food on the table.&nbsp;<\/strong>Yet, Georgia\u2019s housing crisis is impacting families of every background and in every region. Shelter is one of the most basic of requirements; and for too many Georgians, they are days away from eviction, foreclosure or worse,\u201d said&nbsp;<strong>Stacey Abrams<\/strong>. \u201cThe lack of affordable housing and available housing in our state disrupts education, increases crime and weakens the economy. Some are losing their apartments, and others cannot afford to buy their first home. I am the only candidate with a comprehensive plan to address Georgia\u2019s housing crisis. The current governor seems oblivious to what is happening from Atlanta to Valdosta to Augusta, and he has yet to deploy over $450 million in federal funds to stop evictions and keep families whole.&nbsp;<strong>We can build One Georgia, without raising a dollar in taxes, where hardworking Georgians have access to stable, safe and affordable housing and the opportunity to thrive.\u201d&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A significant driver of the affordable housing crisis in Georgia is the limited inventory of reasonably priced, safe, habitable homes and rentals. Across our state, corporations and hedge funds are buying large amounts of property from Albany to Alpharetta to Savannah and beyond. Out-of-state purchases drive up housing costs and prevent everyday Georgians from buying homes. In addition, these purchases often result in the redevelopment of existing properties to primarily target affluent households, which leads to rapidly rising home prices, property taxes, rental prices, and the displacement of longtime neighborhood residents. As evictions increase, so too does crime, food insecurity, and student displacement that costs the rest of Georgians more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the next Governor of Georgia, Stacey will directly tackle the affordable housing crisis in our state and focus on the four central challenges impacting Georgians across the state: the&nbsp;<strong>unaffordability<\/strong>&nbsp;of homes for too many households; the shrinking&nbsp;<strong>inventory<\/strong>&nbsp;of housing; displacement of longtime residents due to&nbsp;<strong>gentrification<\/strong>; and the preventable tragedy of&nbsp;<strong>homelessness<\/strong>.
