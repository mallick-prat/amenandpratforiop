It\u2019s true, I talk about it quite a bit. Medicaid expansion benefits everyone \u2013 even Georgians with private or employer-based health care. Expansion will create 64,000 jobs across our state and help save our hospitals from closing. All while reducing the costs passed on when uninsured people seek care they need, but can\u2019t afford. And, of course, it would provide more than half a million Georgians with access to affordable health care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SECOND CHARACTER:&nbsp;<\/strong>That sounds great. But what is Medicaid?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ABRAMS:<\/strong>&nbsp;Ah, thanks for asking! Medicaid is a public health insurance program that helps make sure people with lower incomes can access affordable health care. It also covers many pregnant women, children, people with disabilities, and it provides long-term care for low-income seniors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in Georgia, for working-age adults without kids, you\u2019re on your own. If you make minimum wage without health insurance at work, you\u2019re left out. Or if you\u2019re taking care of a loved one, you don\u2019t qualify. That\u2019s part of the reason we have the second-highest rate of people without health insurance in the nation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expanding Medicaid would mean that more than half a million Georgians will be able to access affordable health care\u2026 It would mean a lot fewer folks using the emergency room because they don\u2019t have anywhere else to go to access care\u2026 And it would reduce the number of patients who cannot pay, which helps hospitals stay open and can keep costs from being passed on to other people.\u2026&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Medicaid also helps people get and stay healthier because it allows regular wellness checks so doctors can detect problems early on. Take heart disease for example. Early detection and care means a person can access heart medication now and have a much better chance of avoiding a more expensive and potentially deadly heart attack or other complications later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And expanding Medicaid won\u2019t only provide more Georgians with access to health care\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps create the infrastructure to attract more businesses and jobs to Georgia, especially rural Georgia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, how does health care access attract business? It\u2019s simple: No one is going to build a factory or a business where, if a worker gets hurt, they can&#8217;t get help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More people getting help early\u2026. keeping hospitals open\u2026 allows businesses to grow and communities to prosper, especially in rural Georgia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other way expanding Medicaid helps communities is by bringing down the cost of uncompensated care. Now, uncompensated care is just a fancy way to say that when someone shows up in the emergency room and is treated but cannot pay, our tax dollars pay most of the bill. Hospitals eat some of those costs too, which places additional strain on our rural health care providers and our city facilities too. Uncompensated care in Georgia is about $2.7 billion every year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we expand Medicaid and reduce the number of uninsured Georgians, those costs will go down\u2026 way down. And this isn\u2019t a guess or wishful thinking. It\u2019s actually worked in other states for years. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freeing up those funds AND bringing more investment to every corner of our state means more money for schools, roads, bridges, and broadband access\u2026 and better-funded local services like first responders\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let\u2019s talk about mental health. Too often, our local law enforcement is providing mental health services. If we expand Medicaid, more people will have access to mental health care AND demand for mental health professionals will go up, increasing job opportunities. Instead of putting sick people in jail, law enforcement could get folks the mental health treatment and support they need and focus on public safety. Families could get substance abuse treatment for loved ones, and Georgia can attract more mental health providers for our schools and communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SECOND CHARACTER:&nbsp;<\/strong>That sounds great and all, but where does the money to expand Medicaid come from?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ABRAMS:<\/strong>&nbsp;Believe it or not, if you\u2019ve ever paid federal taxes (and most of us have), you\u2019ve already paid for Medicaid expansion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the last ten years, your tax dollars have been going to states that have already expanded Medicaid\u2026 states like Kentucky, California, Indiana, Ohio, Louisiana, and thirty-three other states&#8230;states with both Republican and Democratic governors in charge\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georgia\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp, has the power to expand Medicaid, but he refuses to do it. That means Georgians\u2019 tax dollars are used to lower the cost of care, create new jobs, keep hospitals open and provide access to coverage\u2026 in 38 states other than Georgia!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our tax dollars should be invested here, in Georgia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Medicaid expansion is a clear solution that has worked in 38 states and will work in Georgia too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Governor, I will expand Medicaid\u2026 and work every day to make sure Georgians have access to the affordable health care they need, protect and grow Georgia jobs, and build an economy where every Georgian has the opportunity to thrive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">### &nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ATLANTA&nbsp;&#8211;
