Her plan will work to make quality childcare more affordable, increase the supply of high-quality childcare, achieve Universal Pre-K, increase paid parental leave for Georgia state employees and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe must ensure a strong early start for Georgia\u2019s children \u2014 no matter their zip code or background. The pandemic exposed pervasive issues in early childhood education in Georgia, leaving too many of our state\u2019s families without quality and affordable childcare or Pre-K,\u201d said&nbsp;<strong>Stacey Abrams<\/strong>. \u201cUnlike the current governor, who has said he does not intend to focus on the next decade of need facing Georgia families, I recognize that investing in the long term is how we secure Georgia\u2019s economic future. Ensuring that our children are supported from cradle to career is a central component of my vision for building One Georgia where every family has the freedom and opportunity to thrive.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Georgia\u2019s families to thrive, reliable, safe and developmentally appropriate childcare is essential. In Georgia, it costs $7,644&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geears.org\/news\/cost-child-care-georgia\/?emci=08abeea5-c91c-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">annually<\/a>&nbsp;for child care and the median family&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.census.gov\/quickfacts\/fact\/table\/GA\/INC110220?emci=08abeea5-c91c-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">income<\/a>&nbsp;is $61,224 \u2014 meaning the average Georgia family with two children under four spends about 25% of their income on childcare. Childcare is also not readily available in all parts of the state. In Georgia, 44% of people&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/childcaredeserts.org\/2018\/?state=GA&amp;emci=08abeea5-c91c-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">live<\/a>&nbsp;in a childcare desert and many children are on waitlists for preschool programs. The additional investment of $90 million to add 30,000 permanent childcare slots will allow more families to achieve financial security, and doing so will not require a single new dollar in taxes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stacey Abrams is the only candidate with comprehensive plans to fully fund education and support Georgia\u2019s children, from cradle to career, without raising taxes. To ensure that we invest in our young people at unprecedented levels, Stacey will:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Make quality childcare affordable<\/strong>&nbsp;for more low-income families by increasing funding for CAPS, the childcare assistance program, available for infants and toddlers in all childcare settings. Typically, CAPS pays a portion of childcare costs for families whose childcare expenses exceed 10% of a family\u2019s income. However, Georgia is only serving about 27% of CAPS-eligible children under the age of six. We can change this by adding 30,000 permanent slots to CAPS at an annual cost of $90 million.<\/li><li><strong>Increase and support quality providers<\/strong>:<ul><li>Assist small childcare centers with startup or operating costs through access to $10 million in small business financing programs and through leveraging other private financial opportunities.<\/li><li>Develop a childcare center fund for renovation and repair, which is integral to children\u2019s safety, small childcare businesses\u2019 survival and rural and disadvantaged communities\u2019 access to childcare. &nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>Increase the supply of high-quality child care<\/strong>:<ul><li>Incentivize people to enter and stay in early childhood education through expanding tax credits for childcare workers.<\/li><li>Increase grants and bonuses for childcare professionals who seek further certifications, especially in hard-to-staff areas.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>Achieve Universal Pre-K<\/strong>: Invest in our effective and in-demand Georgia Pre-K program so it is truly universal and accessible to all families that want to participate.<\/li><li><strong>Increase Paid Parental Leave<\/strong>:&nbsp;<ul><li>Advocate for new parents to receive paid time off to care for newborn or recently adopted children, which contributes to healthy development, improves maternal health and enhances families\u2019 economic security.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Expand paid parental leave for Georgia\u2019s state employees. Currently, new parents are eligible for only up to three weeks (120 hours) of paid parental leave per year after the birth or adoption of a child. As governor, I will support families by increasing paid parental leave for state employees and set&nbsp;an example for area businesses.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>Address Childcare Deserts and Overall Childcare Costs<\/strong>: Conduct a statewide analysis to determine where childcare is unavailable and how the state can support lowering childcare costs for everyone. As governor, I will direct resources to areas and issues that need it most.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Stacey Abrams\u2019 full plan to support Georgia\u2019s children by supporting our state\u2019s
