The President and Vice President made clear again today that they are committed to restoring the Senate to safeguard our democracy.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Since the beginning of my campaign, I have stated that anyone who is working to invest in Georgia &#8211; our jobs, our health, our infrastructure, our technology, and our votes &#8211; should come to our state and speak about the good work they are doing. That is exactly what the President and Vice President did today, and I look forward to continuing to work with them to make progress for Georgians.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>While I was not able to attend today\u2019s event, the President and I connected by phone this morning. We reaffirmed our shared commitment to the American project of freedom and democracy, as he did in his remarks today here in Georgia. The President deeply understands that Congress must pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act by whatever legislative means necessary, including reforming or eliminating the filibuster.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I am honored to have worked with allied organizers and the voters of Georgia to deliver our state\u2019s 16 Electoral Votes, flip two U.S. Senate seats to take back the U.S. Senate, flip two U.S. House seats in as many cycles and win dozens of key races at the local level, all within the past four years. Georgia activists have poured themselves into the fight to protect the freedom to vote nationwide while executing a fundamental expansion of power to a diverse electorate in our state. They have registered, engaged and inspired hundreds of thousands of Georgians, particularly voters of color, to exercise their electoral might, resulting in a political transformation of our state.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Georgians are fortunate to be represented by Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, whose presence in the U.S. Senate gave voting rights legislation life and whose perseverance gives its enactment possibility. As a former secretary of state and governor, Senator Manchin understands better than many how vital our elections are to the service of our highest ideals. I appreciate his continued engagement on how to guarantee vibrant and full debate on these bills and hope he will see these bills through to passage. Likewise, as an original sponsor of voting rights legislation, I am grateful to Senator Sinema as she seeks to protect the institution she serves and the constituents put at risk by state legislators unwilling to defend their access to the ballot. These and other leaders will continue to pursue a path to passage without jeopardizing future fights, but our democracy is the cornerstone that must be maintained for our nation to lead. To protect our democracy, I ask all Democratic Senators and Republicans of good conscience to support restoring the Senate via a rule change that will pave the way for swift Senate passage and President Biden\u2019s signature.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his remarks, President Biden declared that if Republicans continue to prevent passage of legislation to protect the freedom to vote, \u201cwe have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><br>###<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ATLANTA &#8211; Today, Stacey Abrams released the following statement: \u201cI thank President Biden and Vice President Harris for returning to Georgia to continue their steadfast&nbsp;&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.4 -
