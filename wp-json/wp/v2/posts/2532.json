I want to make certain that we&#8217;re working with our schools, our technical colleges, and our universities to ensure that we get more young people into the pipeline,&#8221; she said. Another portion of her plan includes creating cluster contracts &#8212; or breaking big contracts into smaller ones to allow companies to bid together. This, Abrams explained, would allow small businesses to not only compete with larger companies that already win big contracts but to grow their businesses over time. Abrams&#8217; plan also includes provisions to help close the racial wealth gap in Georgia. &#8220;People of color comprise 48% of the population and yet only generate 12.2% of the business revenue between government and corporate spend,&#8221; Abrams explained. &#8220;If we do not tackle this problem, it will be 100 years before there is parity between communities of color and non-white, non-minority communities in Georgia in terms of business revenue.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WUGA<\/strong>: &nbsp;\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wuga.org\/local-news\/2022-08-10\/stacey-abrams-reveals-georgia-thrives-economic-address?emci=10f6feb3-e618-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">Stacey Abrams Reveals &#8216;Georgia Thrives&#8217; Economic Address<\/a>\u201d &#8211; \u201cStacey Abrams wants Georgia\u2019s budget surplus to be used to benefit Georgia residents.
