That is why I have repeatedly called on Brian Kemp to end the cheap political stunts and commit to suspending the gas tax through the end of year. Today, Brian Kemp once again refused to provide Georgians with the stability they deserve, and instead is prioritizing politics over committing to a full suspension of the gas tax through the end of the year as I have.<br>&nbsp;<br>Unlike the current governor, I know how difficult it can be to balance a budget or plan your monthly spending without knowing how much prices and taxes might change one day to the next. Georgians are already working hard to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. The very least the governor can do is give Georgia families the reassurance of knowing that the state gas tax will not be in effect for the rest of 2022.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Brian Kemp has already threatened our economy with his extreme agenda that is pushing jobs and business out of the state. He has refused to show leadership again and again, and constantly puts his political ambitions ahead of what is best for Georgians. As governor, I will work hard and fight every day to make sure we put money back in the pockets of Georgia families \u2013 not use political gimmicks to score election year points.\u201d<br>&nbsp;<br>Abrams has repeatedly called for Brian Kemp to commit to suspending the state gas tax for Georgia families through the end of 2022.
