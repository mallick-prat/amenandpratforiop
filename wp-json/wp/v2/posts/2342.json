Gov. Deal bipartisan task force, invest in communities, address cycles of recidivism, support reentry, and more<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ATLANTA&nbsp;<\/strong>&#8211; Today, Democratic nominee for Governor, Stacey Abrams, introduced the first pillar of a comprehensive plan to strengthen public safety, address violent crime and reform criminal justice in Georgia. The first pillar of the plan addresses these issues by combatting the fundamental causes of violence by reducing gun violence, decriminalizing poverty, decreasing recidivism and supporting reentry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEvery Georgian deserves to feel safe in their communities. As governor, I will secure our state so Georgians have the freedom to live, work, go to school and play without fear,\u201d said&nbsp;<strong>Stacey Abrams<\/strong>. \u201cAs House Democratic Leader, I worked across the aisle with former Governor Nathan Deal to pass criminal justice reform in Georgia \u2014 a multi-year bipartisan effort that the current governor irresponsibly disbanded. As violence continues to rise across the state under his leadership, we must recognize that in order to achieve public safety, we must also invest in criminal justice. We cannot punish our way to safety. It doesn\u2019t work &#8211; it never has. As governor, I will build on Governor Deal\u2019s legacy by reconvening the successful, bipartisan coalition that reduced crime, saved taxpayer dollars and made our communities safer.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The first pillar of Abrams\u2019 robust plan to address public safety and criminal justice has received praise from Georgians across the state who are committed to building One Georgia where all of our residents feel safe and have the opportunity to thrive: &nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cStacey\u2019s public safety and criminal justice plan is a comprehensive approach to the challenges facing communities throughout our state. Her plan addresses the issues of public safety from all angles by bringing together stakeholders who understand how to reduce and prevent violent crime while restoring criminal justice reform so that Georgia will be a leader for the nation in advancing public safety,\u201d said&nbsp;<strong>Darius Pattillo, Henry County District Attorney<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019m a Republican, but I support where Stacey stands on this issue because of her track record of working across the aisle with Governor Nathan Deal to find common ground for smart criminal justice reform. I have very personal expectations about her plan to build on Governor Deal\u2019s legacy and implement evidence-based solutions that make our communities safer without tearing families apart. As a mother who lost her son to addiction &#8211; the same addiction that led to his incarceration &#8211; &nbsp;I\u2019ve witnessed the machinery of a cruel system that fails to correct and keep us safe. Since that day, I\u2019ve joined mothers across the nation and of all political backgrounds to give the incarcerated and their families a sincere space to voice their needs,&#8221; said&nbsp;<strong>Kate Boccia, President and CEO of the National Incarceration Association.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Georgia requires a public safety plan that addresses our needs from street corners to corrections facilities. Stacey Abrams&#8217; plan wisely addresses prevention, rapid responses to violence, and bringing new opportunities to those at the end of their sentences. This approach is smart and focused and will bring greater peace and prosperity to every neighborhood and town in Georgia,\u201d said&nbsp;<strong>Kelly Girtz, Mayor of Athens.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI know from experience as a formerly incarcerated woman that we are better supported when the root causes of crime are addressed and not ignored or hidden inside a cage that further exacerbates the problems. Our state and our citizens are better off when we tackle our problems at their roots. We need housing not jail beds, healthcare not handcuffs. We need essential services that will reduce recidivism and build a safer community,\u201d said&nbsp;<strong>Marilynn Winn, criminal justice expert and advocate.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stacey Abrams is the only candidate with a comprehensive plan to address violent crime and reform our criminal justice system in Georgia.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specifically, as governor, she will:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Combat the fundamental causes of violence and decriminalize poverty:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Expand Medicaid to broaden access to mental health and substance abuse treatment and reduce the role of law enforcement in crisis intervention<\/li><li>Support wraparound services for high-risk communities to decrease incident rates, including targeting challenged schools\/neighborhoods that produce a disproportionate number of youth offenders<\/li><li>Require civil rather than criminal penalties for certain traffic and low-level drug offenses to reduce recidivism and escalation of criminal behavior<\/li><li>Target programs to increase educational and community opportunities for at-risk young people beginning in 3rd grade through joint projects with schools and nonprofits&nbsp;<\/li><li>Secure mental health and behavioral therapy for highest-risk youth and offer family interventions<\/li><li>Expand employment training and opportunities, including apprenticeships, for high-risk youth<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduce gun violence:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Coordinate with and secure financial incentives for local governments, law enforcement agencies, and community organizations to design and implement violence intervention programs<\/li><li>Reduce guns on the streets by repealing bills that needlessly endanger Georgians \u2014 including criminal carry, campus carry, and the 2014 \u201cGuns Everywhere\u201d law<\/li><li>Close the background check loophole for private transfers and gun show sales<\/li><li>Close the domestic violence perpetrators loophole<\/li><li>Adopt red flag legislation to prevent those who pose a danger to themselves or others to purchase a weapon or to be reported for protective actions<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Reduce recidivism and support reentry:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Establish a new Public Safety and Criminal Justice Reform Task Force that builds on Governor Nathan Deal\u2019s legacy by reconvening stakeholders \u2014 including law enforcement, prosecutors, criminal defense attorneys, judges, advocates, and formerly incarcerated Georgians \u2014 to collaborate on evidence-based solutions to our public safety challenges<\/li><li>Restore and expand proven interventions like eliminating private probation, expanding diversion programs and funding accountability courts such as veterans\u2019 courts and drug courts<\/li><li>Realign investments in treatment, education, and job training that will enable people to live crime-free lives after release<\/li><li>Strengthen self-help programs for people released from prison,&nbsp;<\/li><li>Expand access to mental health and substance abuse treatment through Medicaid expansion<\/li><li>Incentivize employers to hire people reentering their community<\/li><li>Enact Clean Slate legislation that offers automatic clearing of criminal records once someone remains crime-free for a set period of time<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>View Stacey Abrams\u2019 full plan&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/staceyabrams.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/PublicSafety_Plan_06162022.pdf?emci=e04fb1ee-1ded-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">###<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Abrams\u2019 plan would reconvene fmr.
