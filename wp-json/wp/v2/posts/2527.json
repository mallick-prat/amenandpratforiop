Her plan includes creating 20,000 apprenticeships, investing in free technical college, and establishing a need-based financial aid program \u2014 all without raising taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGeorgians deserve the ability to pursue educational opportunities beyond high school that will not saddle them with debt. Access to college rewrote my family story and saved our lives.\u201d said&nbsp;<strong>Stacey Abrams<\/strong>. \u201cAs governor, I will create 20,000 apprenticeships, restore free technical college, and fund a need-based financial aid program to ensure that students have access to the post-secondary programs they need to help build Georgia&#8217;s economic future and thrive. We can finance this through existing resources, including the $1.06 billion in lottery reserves. In addition, my administration will champion a constitutional amendment to allow sports gaming and casinos in Georgia, as a permanent source of revenue to underwrite broader access to education.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of Georgia\u2019s students and adult learners do not have the support they need to start or successfully complete their post-secondary journey. Georgia is one of only two states and the only state in the South without a need-based financial aid program. The cost of going to technical college or four-year college is often prohibitive to students and by 2025, over half of the jobs in Georgia will require some form of post-secondary credential. Additionally, in Georgia, 42% of college students do not receive financial support from their parents and almost 40% experience food or housing insecurity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By increasing access to post-secondary learning through apprenticeships, technical college or traditional four-year college education, Georgia can build a skilled workforce ready to compete. More importantly, with these skills, Georgians can earn good wages that allow more choices and economic security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stacey Abrams is the only candidate with comprehensive plans to ensure Georgians have the educational opportunities to help them thrive, whether it be a robust apprenticeship program or a two- or four-year college degree.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>STACEY\u2019S PLAN<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pathway to Higher Learning<\/strong><br>Higher learning in Georgia must include apprenticeships, free technical college and affordable college education, and to that end, Stacey will:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Generate more than 20,000 additional apprenticeships<\/strong>&nbsp;in fields ranging from building trades and construction to coding and healthcare by working with technical colleges, small businesses and unions and drawing down federal funds.<\/li><li><strong>Restore free technical college for all Georgians<\/strong>. Georgia\u2019s technical colleges play a vital role for many students by emphasizing career-focused, hands-on training in trades and technical skills. Budget issues eliminated tuition-free technical certificates and diplomas for all students more than a decade ago; however, Georgia can now fund this vital program, including for students with lower GPAs or less-favored majors, using existing lottery reserves and by expanding gaming. This investment will make lucrative career options accessible to more Georgians.<\/li><li><strong>Fund Georgia\u2019s need-based financial aid program<\/strong>. While Georgia recently created a need-based aid program, no funding has been allocated for this purpose. A fully-funded program will coordinate with the Georgia Student Finance Authority to establish criteria and guidelines for participation. An Abrams administration will finance this program through the expansion of sports betting and casino gaming in Georgia.<\/li><li><strong>Ensure all school districts and counties have access to career, technical and agricultural education (CTAE) programs<\/strong>. These high school courses utilize a combination of hands-on and classroom learning to expose students to potential careers and can allow students to gain certification in certain fields. Expanding these programs allows students to gain access to lucrative fields at a young age and enter the post-secondary world with greater clarity on their career goals.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Create Farm to Future Initiative to increase student participation in agriculture<\/strong>. Agriculture is the number one industry in Georgia. Georgia must ensure the next generation of farmers are ready to supply our food and support our economy. Programs will include agribusiness apprenticeships, technical college supports and more robust agricultural training in K-12 schools to ensure Georgia continues to be a leader in agriculture.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Stacey Abrams\u2019 full plan to ensure Georgia\u2019s students and adult learners are prepared to thrive in job training, college and career can be
