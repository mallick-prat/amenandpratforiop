Abrams drew a sharp contrast between \u201cBrian Kemp\u2019s Georgia\u201d and the one she and other Democrats would push for. She criticized Kemp for failing to invest the state\u2019s surplus in programs that would help Georgians.\u201cWe have the power, Georgia, let\u2019s get it done,\u201d Abrams said as she wrapped up the daylong convention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Associated Press:<\/strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/abortion-2022-midterm-elections-biden-georgia-b318e52eb214685e8b8da43d7e46872f?emci=76497401-0128-ed11-bd6e-281878b914e7&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}\">Abrams, Georgia Dems call midterms \u2018unfinished business\u2019<\/a><br>August 27, 2022<br>By Bill Barrow and Jeff Amy&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to defy all the naysayers and take our state all the way back,\u201d Abrams told delegates to the Democratic state convention Saturday. \u201cGeorgia Democrats, we\u2019ve got unfinished business to take care of.\u201d [&#8230;] \u201cStanding with me is the most extraordinary ticket Georgia has ever produced,\u201d Abrams said before she addressed the convention. \u201cIt looks like Georgia; it sounds like Georgia; it knows Georgia.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Below are key excerpts from Abrams\u2019 remarks:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cToday, Georgia Democrats, we know what must be done. We must seize opportunity and change the future for Georgians. We have a once-in-a-generation surplus \u2014 $5 billion delivered by the Democrats we sent to Washington. Our path is clear \u2014 we must pour it into those who\u2019ve been waiting for Georgia leaders to see them and know they too can help Georgia rise.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTo do that, Democrats, though, we must have the courage to believe more is possible. We must reject the poverty of imagination that the GOP has gaslighted us into accepting as truth. We understand that government is tool, not a weapon. And that investing in One Georgia \u2014 in every corner, in every community \u2014 is how we truly power this great state. But we must believe we are worthy of One Georgia. One where we invest in our children from cradle to career and pay our educators a professional wage \u2014 one that keeps them in the classroom, not the courtroom. A Georgia where we value our bus drivers and paraprofessionals. Where school counselors actually have time to help our children. Where we listen to our parents and fully fund education as a guarantee, not an election year gimmick. One where we reject the right to work for less. Where we know that if we want paychecks to pay more than a minimum wage, we must have a government that is not only business-friendly, it is worker-friendly.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBrian Kemp told us who he was when he ran four years ago: someone who would point a shotgun at a child and invective at immigrants in order to gain Donald Trump\u2019s favor. And now he\u2019s hiding from justice because he\u2019s afraid Georgia voters might notice he\u2019s still that same extremist who refuses to do right by our people. Brian Kemp and his ticket want us to believe that the change we\u2019ve fought for is impossible, that the taxes we\u2019ve paid and money that is in our coffers does not belong to the citizens of Georgia. But I\u2019m here to tell you, it\u2019s time we get what we paid for. Our $3.5 billion a year in Medicaid expansion. Our $450 million in rental eviction relief. Our billions for good paying jobs across Georgia, and a free technical college and need-based aid for our students. While Georgia families are struggling, he would have us believe we must choose between addressing generations of structural racial inequity or building an economy that works for everyone.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI decided to run again because I believe in Georgia. In One Georgia. Because I know who we are and what we are capable of achieving. And as I stand here today, I know we\u2019ve got this. In this campaign, I\u2019ve traveled from Camden to Fannin, from Tifton to Taliferro. From Atlanta to Augusta to Albany to Athens. And right here in Columbus, in Southwest Georgia, we will take our stand. We speak with different voices and languages and come from different backgrounds. Our families may not look alike, and we will worship in our own ways. Our needs will sometimes conflict and our dreams may diverge. But no matter who we are and where we come from \u2014 we all want to live in a Georgia where: All of our children learn the truth of our past so they can build a better future. &nbsp;Where voting rights and women\u2019s rights and LGBTQ rights and worker\u2019s rights and disability rights and fundamental, basic, inalienable constitutional liberties are not at the whim of a governor who believes in the sinister appeal of \u201cstate\u2019s rights.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><br>###<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Abrams ended the state
